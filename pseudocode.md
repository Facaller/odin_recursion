The Edge Case: Empty List, Insert at Index 0
Scenario:

The list is empty: no nodes exist, this.head === null

You're calling insertAt(value, 0)

Your current code returns early when this.head === null, even if the index is 0 — meaning it skips the insert entirely

This behavior might be overly strict, depending on your design.

🧠 Step-by-Step Breakdown to Handle It Properly
1. Decide What’s Valid

Ask yourself:

Should it be valid to insert at index 0 in an empty list?

Answer: Generally, yes — inserting at the beginning of an empty list is a very common and valid operation.

So your method should allow insertAt(value, 0) even if the list is currently empty.

2. Update Your Early Return Logic

Right now, your early return says:

If the list is empty (this.head === null), just exit.

That’s too broad. Instead:

Allow the method to proceed if index === 0

But still block it if index is greater than 0 — you can't insert at index 1 or higher in an empty list

3. Handle the Insertion

If it's index 0 in an empty list, you simply:

Create the new node

Set it as the head of the list

Set its nextNode to null (or just leave it at default)

Nothing else is needed — no loop, no traversal.

4. Confirm All Edge Conditions

Once this is handled, you'll be supporting:

Case	Should Work?	Outcome
Insert at 0 in empty list	✅ Yes	New head is created
Insert at > 0 in empty list	❌ No	Out of bounds — return or error
5. Test It Mentally

Think through:

List starts empty

Insert at 0 → should become 1 node with that value

Insert at 1 → invalid

Insert at -1 → invalid

If your method supports these exactly, you're done.

✅ Summary of What You Need to Adjust

Allow insert at index 0 even when list is empty

Still prevent inserts at any higher index when list is empty

Do not rely on the loop in this case — just insert directly

Let me know if you want help building test cases or reasoning through how these edge cases might look when calling toString() or other methods after insertion. You're nearly at a fully robust implementation!
